**Intro**

Hello my name is Jordan-Michael Kirk. This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. It uses all the skills I have learned so far and uses them all together. I created this project from scratch creating the HTML latout and adding CSS to give the project the correct look and feel as directed by the FIGMA file attached.
