# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

Hello my name is Jordan-Michael Kirk. This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. It uses all the skills I have learned so far and uses them all together. I created this project from scratch creating the HTML latout and adding CSS to give the project the correct look and feel as directed by the FIGMA file attached.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
